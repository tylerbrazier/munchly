TODO
====
- eslint
- don't require a description for menu items (e.g. fries) and account for this
  in the ui
- nice 404 page
- allow `priceFormat()` or something to be defined in `local.js`; some
  restaurants may not want dollar signs.
- figure out a good domain name - rename from eatfargo
- get an real SSL cert (letsencrypt.org)
- escape html in template strings
