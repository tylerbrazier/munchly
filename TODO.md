TODO
====
- don't require a description for menu items (e.g. fries) and account for this
  in the ui
- nice 404 page
- allow `priceFormat()` or something to be defined in `local.js`; some
  restaurants may not want dollar signs.
- get an real SSL cert (letsencrypt.org)
- escape html in template strings
- consider using jimp (https://www.npmjs.com/package/jimp) instead of lwip
